## 🔍 Feature Importance Analysis (Random Forest)

### 📊 Top Features:
- **age**: Most important feature by a significant margin.
- **mh_share**: Indicates a person’s willingness to share mental health information.
- **country**: Suggests regional or cultural differences matter.
- **mh_coworker_discussion** and **workplace_resources**: Reflect a supportive environment's impact.

### 📉 Less Important Features:
- **medical_coverage**, **tech_company**, and **mh_employer_discussion**: Least important among included features.

### ✅ Conclusion:
The model highlights **individual factors** (like age and openness about mental health) and **workplace discussion culture** as more influential than benefits or employer policies.

## 📊 Model Performance (Classification Report)

### 🔢 Key Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 67.87% — Decent but not outstanding.
- **Precision / Recall / F1 (Class 1)**: ~77% — Strong performance on this class.

### ⚖️ Class Imbalance:
- **Class 0**: Poor performance (~47% F1).
- **Class 1**: Significantly better, suggesting a **bias toward the more frequent class**.

### ✅ Conclusion:
- The model handles **Class 1** well but struggles with **Class 0**.
- Indicates **class imbalance**.
- Consider techniques like:
  - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**
  - **Class weighting**
  - **Under/oversampling**

## 📈 AUC Score

- **AUC = 0.689**
  - Moderate discriminatory power.
  - Better than random (0.5), but room for improvement.

## 🧠 Final Takeaways

| Aspect             | Insight                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Top Predictors** | Age, willingness to share mental health status, and workplace support.  |
| **Model Strength** | Handles Class 1 well, decent AUC, and clear feature importance.         |
| **Model Weakness** | Performs poorly on Class 0 — likely due to class imbalance.             |
| **Next Steps**     | Handle imbalance, tune hyperparameters, and try other models (e.g., XGBoost). |
